TODO:

- Retrieve and store live data on simulation's status
- Setup a databse based on simulated sensors
- Read commands/coords from DB and act accordingly
- Store Movements in a DB
- Final communication tests with Raspberry Pi
- Unit-testing
- Make a simple panel
- Add compression method to the communication channel

In Progress:

- Refactor communication code to be object-oriented

Done:

- Establish communication between 2 computers through IP network
- Get the simulations running on your device
- Add TCP/UDP capability to the client/server code
- Store recieved commands/coords in a database
- Simulate IR sensor data
- Enbale sending images/matrices through the channel

On Hold:

- Enable multiple connections with the server
    - Enable connections on multiple ports
    - Test on sensor + robot data
    - Refactor & document code
